# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence
# NAME: Madhupriya R
# REG NO:212224040177

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## 🧾 Program
```
x=("s", 8, "a", "v", "n", "g", "u", "r", "c", "e") 
print("n" in x) 
print(8 in x)
```

## Output
![439304784-44697301-a4c1-4deb-81b4-2e5b1382f7be](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f7eb0e1-010a-4a6b-94d5-c52a00253553)

## Result
Thus, the program has been executed successfully.
